# Million.js Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Backup current `next.config.ts`
- [ ] Update Million.js to latest version: `npm install million@latest`
- [ ] Review Million.js documentation for React 19 compatibility

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Uncomment Million.js configuration in `next.config.ts`
- [ ] Update configuration for optimal React Server Components support
- [ ] Ensure proper integration with existing Turbopack setup

## Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Run development server with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test all critical user flows:
  - [ ] 3D interactive components
  - [ ] Chat interface functionality  
  - [ ] Audio playback and recording
  - [ ] Progress tracking and achievements
  - [ ] Textbook navigation and content loading
- [ ] Verify React DevTools still function properly
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e`

## Phase 4: Performance Validation
- [ ] Run bundle analysis: `npm run build:analyze`
- [ ] Compare before/after bundle sizes
- [ ] Measure component re-render counts in development
- [ ] Test Lighthouse performance scores

## Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Create production build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Monitor for any runtime errors or performance regressions
- [ ] Roll out to production if all tests pass

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert `next.config.ts` to backup
2. Remove Million.js dependency
3. Rebuild and redeploy
