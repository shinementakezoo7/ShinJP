# Performance Optimization PRD: Enable Million.js Compiler

## Overview
Enable Million.js compiler to achieve 70% faster React performance by leveraging fine-grained reactivity and automatic memoization.

## Problem Statement
Current Next.js application uses standard React rendering which can lead to unnecessary re-renders and suboptimal performance, especially with complex interactive components like 3D scenes, chat interfaces, and real-time learning features.

## Solution
Enable Million.js compiler that's already configured but commented out in `next.config.ts`.

## Technical Implementation
1. Uncomment Million.js configuration in `next.config.ts` (lines 113-116)
2. Update Million.js dependency to latest version
3. Test compatibility with React Server Components and existing features
4. Monitor performance improvements through bundle analysis

## Success Metrics
- 50-70% reduction in component re-renders
- Improved Lighthouse performance scores
- Faster page load times for interactive components
- Reduced bundle size through automatic memoization

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Compatibility Issues**: Test thoroughly with all interactive components (3D, chat, audio)
- **Build Failures**: Have rollback plan ready by keeping current config as backup
- **Debugging Complexity**: Ensure development tools still work properly

## Timeline
- Implementation: 1 day
- Testing: 2 days  
- Deployment: 1 day

## Dependencies
- Next.js 15.5.5 (already satisfied)
- React 19.2.0 (already satisfied)
