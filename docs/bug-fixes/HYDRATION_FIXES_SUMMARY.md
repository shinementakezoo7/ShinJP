# Hydration Issue Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. QueryClientProvider Error
**Problem**: "No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one"
**Solution**: Implemented proper QueryClient initialization pattern that works for both server and client environments in `src/app/providers.tsx`

### 2. Hydration Mismatches in JapaneseLiquidHero
**Problem**: Server-client HTML mismatches causing hydration errors
**Solution**: Added proper mounting checks for all animated elements:
- Koi fish animations
- Sakura petal animations
- Lantern animations
- Sparkle effects
- Conditional rendering based on `mounted` state

### 3. Date-based Content Issues
**Problem**: Dynamic date-based content causing server-client mismatches
**Solution**: Removed seasonal content that changed based on `new Date().getMonth()`

## Key Changes Made

### Providers Fix (`src/app/providers.tsx`)
- Implemented singleton pattern for QueryClient
- Added proper client/server detection
- Ensured consistent QueryClient instance across renders

### JapaneseLiquidHero Fixes (`src/components/hero/JapaneseLiquidHero.tsx`)
- Wrapped all animated elements in `mounted` checks
- Removed date-based seasonal content
- Ensured consistent initial render between server and client

## Browser Extension Note
The `bis_skin_checked` attribute is added by browser extensions (like Bitwarden) and cannot be fixed in application code. Users should:
1. Disable browser extensions when developing/testing
2. Test in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Use clean browser profiles for development

## Testing
- Application builds successfully
- No more QueryClientProvider errors
- Reduced hydration mismatches
- Components render consistently between server and client
