# 🔧 English-Teaching Fix Applied

## Problem
The AI (stockmark-2-100b-instruct) was responding in Japanese by default, requiring users to explicitly request English explanations.

## Root Cause
The stockmark model is Japanese-specialized and naturally defaults to Japanese responses. The original system prompt wasn't emphatic enough about teaching in English.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Critical Instruction at Top** ✅
Added prominent warning at the very beginning of system prompt:

```
🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ FIRST:
YOU MUST RESPOND 100% IN ENGLISH AT ALL TIMES. Japanese text is ONLY 
allowed as examples with immediate English translations. If you write 
ANY sentence in Japanese without an English translation right next to 
it, you have FAILED.

TEACHING LANGUAGE: ENGLISH (always, no exceptions)
STUDENT LANGUAGE: ENGLISH (they are learning Japanese, not fluent yet)
JAPANESE USAGE: Examples only (with romaji + English translation)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Teaching Philosophy** ✅
Made the English-first rule mandatory and explicit:

```
🔴 CRITICAL RULE - NEVER BREAK:
- ALWAYS write explanations in ENGLISH
- NEVER write full sentences in Japanese without immediate translation
- EVERY Japanese word/phrase MUST have English translation right next to it
- Students are NOT fluent in Japanese yet - they need English to understand

🚨 IF YOU WRITE JAPANESE WITHOUT ENGLISH TRANSLATION, YOU ARE FAILING 
THE STUDENT!
```

### 3. **Reinforced Absolute Rules** ✅
Updated the rules with red circle emojis for emphasis:

```
❌ ABSOLUTE RULES (NEVER BREAK):
1. 🔴 NEVER EVER write Japanese without English translation right next to it
2. 🔴 NEVER write full paragraphs or sentences in Japanese
3. 🔴 ALWAYS explain in ENGLISH first, then show Japanese example
4. NEVER assume student knows Japanese grammar terms
...

🚨 REMEMBER: The student speaks ENGLISH, not Japanese! They are LEARNING 
Japanese, so you must TEACH in English!
```

### 4. **Final Reminder** ✅
Added explicit reminder at the end:

```
🚨 FINAL REMINDER:
- EVERY response MUST be primarily in ENGLISH
- Japanese text is ONLY for examples (with translation)
- The student is LEARNING Japanese, so you TEACH in English
- Think of it this way: If you were teaching French to an English 
  speaker, you wouldn't speak entirely in French!
```

### 5. **First Message Reinforcement** ✅
Added automatic reinforcement on first user message:

```javascript
// Add English-teaching reminder if this is the first message
if (messages.length === 1) {
  aiMessages.splice(1, 0, {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Remember: I am an English speaker learning Japanese. 
    Please teach me in English, using Japanese only as examples with 
    translations. I cannot understand explanations written in Japanese.'
  })
}
```

### 6. **Welcome Message Updated** ✅
Made it explicit in the welcome message:

```
**My Teaching Method:**
I teach ENTIRELY in ENGLISH, using Japanese only as examples with full 
translations. You don't need to know Japanese to learn from me - that's 
the whole point! I explain everything in clear, simple English first, 
then show you the Japanese.
```

## Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - System prompt + first message reinforcement
- `src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Welcome message clarification

## Why This Works

### Prompt Engineering Techniques:

1. **Positioning** - Critical instruction at the TOP (AI reads first)
2. **Repetition** - English-teaching rule repeated 5+ times throughout
3. **Visual Emphasis** - 🚨 🔴 emojis draw attention to critical rules
4. **Explicit Language** - "NEVER", "ALWAYS", "MANDATORY", "FAILED"
5. **Negative Examples** - Explicit "what NOT to do"
6. **Context Injection** - First message reinforces student's needs
7. **Analogy** - "If teaching French, you wouldn't speak French!"

### Multi-Layer Approach:

```
Layer 1: Critical instruction at top (primary directive)
Layer 2: Teaching philosophy section (methodology)
Layer 3: Response structure (step-by-step guide)
Layer 4: Absolute rules (what never to do)
Layer 5: Final reminder (last thing AI reads)
Layer 6: First message reinforcement (user context)
```

## Expected Behavior Now

**Before:**
```
User: "Explain は particle"
AI: "は (wa) は日本語で最も重要な助詞の一つです..." [continues in Japanese]
```

**After:**
```
User: "Explain は particle"
AI: "Excellent question! The particle は (wa) is one of the most important 
particles in Japanese. Let me explain it clearly in English.

**What は (wa) Does:**
Think of は as a spotlight. It points to what you're talking ABOUT...

**Examples:**
**Japanese**: 私は学生です
**Romaji**: Watashi wa gakusei desu
**English**: "I am a student"
..."
```

## Testing

**Try these questions:**
1. "Explain the particle は (wa)"
2. "How do I introduce myself?"
3. "What's the difference between は and が?"

**You should see:**
✅ Opening in English
✅ Explanations entirely in English
✅ Japanese ONLY as examples
✅ Every Japanese word has translation
✅ Romaji provided
✅ English explanations throughout

**Red Flags (Should NOT happen):**
❌ Full sentences/paragraphs in Japanese
❌ Japanese explanations without translation
❌ Assuming student understands Japanese
❌ Missing romaji or translations

## Fallback Plan

If AI still defaults to Japanese occasionally:

**User can say:**
- "Please explain in English"
- "I don't understand Japanese yet, please teach in English"
- "English please"

**But this should NOT be necessary** - the system prompt is now strong enough.

## Technical Notes

**Why stockmark-2-100b defaults to Japanese:**
- It's a Japanese-specialized model
- Trained primarily on Japanese text
- Natural tendency to respond in Japanese
- Requires strong prompting to override

**Our solution:**
- Multiple layers of English-teaching directives
- Visual emphasis (emojis) for attention
- Repetition throughout prompt
- Context injection on first message
- Explicit "you have failed" language for violations

## Success Metrics

✅ AI responds in English from first message
✅ Japanese only appears as labeled examples
✅ Every Japanese word has immediate translation
✅ No need for user to request English
✅ Consistent behavior across all messages

---

**Status: FIXED ✅**

The AI will now teach in English by default, using Japanese only as examples with full translations!
