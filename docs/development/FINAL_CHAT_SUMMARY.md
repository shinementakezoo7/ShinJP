### 3. **Example Teaching Style**

**Student asks:** "What is the particle は (wa)?"

**Sensei Tanaka responds:**

```
Great question! 🎯 The particle は (wa) is one of the most important 
particles in Japanese. Let me explain it clearly.

**What は (wa) Does:**
は marks the TOPIC of your sentence - it's like saying "As for..." 
or "Speaking of..." in English.

**Structure:**
[Topic] は [Rest of sentence]

**Examples:**

1. 私は学生です (Watashi wa gakusei desu)
   - Translation: "I am a student"
   - Literally: "As for me, (I) am a student"

2. これは本です (Kore wa hon desu)
   - Translation: "This is a book"
   - Literally: "As for this, (it) is a book"

3. 日本は美しいです (Nihon wa utsukushii desu)
   - Translation: "Japan is beautiful"
   - Literally: "As for Japan, (it) is beautiful"

**Important Notes:**
- は is written as "ha" but pronounced as "WA" (only when used as particle!)
- It tells us what we're talking ABOUT

**Common Mistake ❌:**
Students often confuse は (wa) with が (ga). Here's the difference:
- は = topic marker ("speaking of...")
- が = subject marker ("this one specifically does...")

**Practice Tip 💡:**
Start simple sentences with "As for [X]..." then add は. For example:
"As for me..." = 私は (watashi wa)

Would you like me to explain the が (ga) particle next? 😊
