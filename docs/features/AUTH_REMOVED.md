## 🔧 Remaining Auth-Related Files (Not Removed)

These files remain in the codebase but are not currently used:

- `src/lib/auth/` - Auth utilities (kept for potential future use)
- `src/lib/database/users.ts` - User database functions

   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/app/\(auth\)
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/SessionProvider.tsx
   ```
