# Japanese-Themed Hero Section Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for creating a Japanese-themed hero section that "sears the screen" with authentic cultural elements and modern web technologies.

## Design Vision
> "Ink-black gradients bleeding into neon sakura pink, a Kintsugi gold thread dividing the viewport, parallax Mount Fuji silhouette vanishing into negative space, micro-animated kanji calligraphy that ignites on hover like shodo brushed with sparklers, a subtle shoji-screen grid overlay that flexes with scroll, a single origami crane that folds itself into the CTA button, and a koto-string vibration sound on click—every pixel must feel like the first sip of matcha under a Kyoto moon."
